"""Calc -> Pico -> desktop bridge, supervised.

Owns the lifecycle: wifi connect, socket connect, listen_loop. Catches
network failures and reconnects with exponential backoff. LED on the
Pico W reflects state so the unit is observable when sealed.

States (onboard LED on machine.Pin("LED")):
  off            : pre-init / fatal
  solid          : wifi connecting
  slow blink 1Hz : wifi up, socket down
  fast blink 4Hz : socket up, idle (waiting on calc)
  brief flash    : packet relayed (visual ping)

Blink is cooperative: ticked between DBUS packets. A long DBUS transfer
freezes the LED, which is informative -- the thing is busy on the wire.
