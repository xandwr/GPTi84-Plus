"""Calc <-> Pico <-> desktop bridge, supervised.

Owns the lifecycle: wifi connect, socket connect, listen_loop. Catches
network failures and reconnects with exponential backoff. LED on the
Pico W reflects state so the unit is observable when sealed.

States (onboard LED on machine.Pin("LED")):
  off            : pre-init / fatal
  solid          : wifi connecting
  slow blink 1Hz : wifi up, socket down
  fast blink 4Hz : socket up, idle (waiting on calc)
  brief flash    : packet relayed (visual ping)

Blink is cooperative: ticked between DBUS packets. A long DBUS transfer
freezes the LED, which is informative -- the thing is busy on the wire.

Direction model (post-2026-04-28 Str1/Str2 pivot):
  calc -> Pico   : asm program _SendVarCmds Str1 to us. on_var callback
                   sees a String var (type 0x04, name [0xAA, tStr1, ...]),
                   translates the token stream to ASCII, ships the text
                   over TCP.
  Pico -> calc   : when a desktop frame arrives, translate ASCII back to
                   tokens and PC-master push as Str2. Calc must be at
                   the home screen for the OS's idle silent-link receive
                   to accept it; the asm program exits immediately after
                   _SendVarCmd so the calc is back at the home screen
                   by the time the desktop reply round-trips.

User UX: at home screen, "text"->Str1, run prgmCHAT, then Str2 ENTER
to see the reply.

Why PC-master push and not calc-master REQ: every variant of calc-as-
master receive we tried (_GetSmallPacket, _GetVariableData inside the
asm program) wedges the calc's keypad matrix post-recv. PC-master push
to a calc at the home screen completes cleanly. Two-step UX (run, then
Str2 to see reply) is the price.
