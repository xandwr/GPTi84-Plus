"""Calc <-> Pico <-> desktop bridge, supervised.

Owns the lifecycle: wifi connect, socket connect, listen_loop. Catches
network failures and reconnects with exponential backoff. LED on the
Pico W reflects state so the unit is observable when sealed.

States (onboard LED on machine.Pin("LED")):
  off            : pre-init / fatal
  solid          : wifi connecting
  slow blink 1Hz : wifi up, socket down
  fast blink 4Hz : socket up, idle (waiting on calc)
  brief flash    : packet relayed (visual ping)

Blink is cooperative: ticked between DBUS packets. A long DBUS transfer
freezes the LED, which is informative -- the thing is busy on the wire.

Direction model (post-2026-04-28):
  calc -> Pico   : on_var callback in listen_loop ships the AppVar body
                   over TCP (unchanged from the original v0).
  Pico -> calc   : 1-slot outbox holds the latest desktop-sourced frame.
                   When the calc issues a DBUS REQ for CHATIN, on_req
                   pops the outbox and serves it as the AppVar body.
                   If the outbox is empty, on_req returns None and the
                   Pico replies with SKIP (calc-side renders no-reply).

The PC-master push path that lived here pre-shipping (`_push_chatin`
via `transfer.send_var`) is gone. Calc-master REQ is the only inbound
direction now -- see project_calc_master_req_shipped.md.
